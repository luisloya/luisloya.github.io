# Completed Projects
The below projects are only authored by me unless otherwise noted. These projects cannot be copied by other researchers and I welcome any feedback and collaboration requests.

## Topic Modeling Ukraine-Whistleblower News Coverage
This research project seeks to better understand the topic trends surrounding this case, how they develop over time, and variation by outlet based on ideological leaning. This study is specifically exploratory and does not assume any topic pattern before data collection. The study is the beginning of a broader research project, and begins with an exploration of the Trump-Ukraine case by utilizing Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to explore prominent topics from 3 news outlets, from the beginning of the story to the most recent developments.

## #Donatenow!: A computer-assisted analysis of musician’s political engagement on Twitter
by Lukito, J., Loya, L., Davalos, C., Li, J., & Tong, C
Presented at the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication Annual Conference (2019)

Musicians have historically been one of the most active celebrity groups in terms of discussing
social and political issues. In this paper, we advance the growing field of celebrity advocacy by
systematically studying musicians’ political engagement on Twitter. Through a computationalassisted
analysis of 2,286,434 tweets, we group 881 musicians into three categories of political
engagement on Twitter: not engaged (comprising most artists), circumstantial engagement, and
active political engagement. We examine the latter categories in detail with two qualitative case
studies. The findings indicate that musicians from different genres have distinct patterns of
political engagement. Christian artists are most likely to be circumstantially engaged, with many
discussing philanthropic efforts. On the other hand, the most active accounts are rock and hiphop
artists, some of whom discuss political issues and call for mobilization. We conclude with
suggestions for future research.

## Queer Performances on TikTok
by Loya, L.  and Almeida, A.
Presented at Communication Crossroads at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2020)
We completed a descriptive qualitative content analysis analyzing queer performances on TikTok through exploring popular hashtags using keywords: gay, lesbian, transgender, queer, bi. Our analysis builds on extant literature of digital queer experiences, which highlights emerging digital landscapes as active sites of expression, solidarity and connection among queer individuals, particuarly queer youth. Through this study, we use the Communication Theory of Identity  to discuss the various performances of queerness in forming community from shared pain, joy and lust. This study was conducted in the aftermath of TikTok shadowbanning queer content and we discuss how performance and humor serve resiliency roles for queer youths in digital arenas. 


## The Effect of Proximity on Framing Protest
Presented at the National Communication Association Conference (2017)

In this project, I inquire how media outlets adjust their framing when reporting on protests that are in close proximity to their offices. I overview existing content analyses and find that in the case of Occupy Wall St. and severa  isolated protest events, there appears to be a consistent relationship between proximity and framing. In cases where the protest or movement is local, newspaper and television media employ negative framings: lawlessness, show, public disapproval, negative impact, and ineffective goals. In contrast with this, when coverage extends beyond the local sphere, though not necessarily foreign, news coverage tends to employ more positive framings of the movement and its participants using frames that counter the local coverage.

## Net Neutrality
This paper is a qualitative content analysis of newspaper coverage of the net neutrality debate from 2006-2018. This research explores how internet service providers are used as opinion leaders and the popular frames used to de/legitimize decisions made by the FCC.
